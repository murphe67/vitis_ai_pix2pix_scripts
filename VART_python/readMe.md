# VART

## VART Example

This script is from https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-AI/blob/1.4.1/demo/VART/resnet50_mt_py/resnet50.py, which uses a pytorch ResNet50 xmodel
file you have to download.

## Pix2Pix Test

This script is from https://github.com/mrzhu-cool/pix2pix-pytorch/blob/master/test.py, the original pix2pix repo I worked off of.

## test.py

Both scripts spliced together. It needs to be ran in the Vitis AI docker, but using .xmodel files doesn't have dependencies the way
.pth files do, and so is usually easier to get running.
